# LangPro-Editor
LangPro-editor is a simple web-based editor that allows you to make limited alternations of tableaux created by [LangPro](https://naturallogic.pro/LangPro/).  
A live version of this website can be found on [borisdegaaff.nl/LangPro-editor](https://borisdegraaff.nl/LangProEditor).  

When a tableau is created with `.tableau.prove()`  in LangPro, in the directory `LangPro/xml` 2 tableaux in XML format can be found.  Upload these files to the LangPro-Editor in order to make changes to them.
